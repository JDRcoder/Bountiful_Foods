            <p>Is a small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods. We are physically located in Carlsbad,
                California, however, we have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San
                Diego. Our company sells fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, but also uses some
                national and international suppliers. We are a owner-operated company that caters to walk in traffic at our
                storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, our food trucks. We deliver and manage those orders on the
                phone and via the website. Our mission is to provide fresh and healthy food options, including organic,
                made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting the coastal
                areas.</p> -->
